<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Type-safety of callbacks (signals, slots)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Both functions and class member methods with any number parameters can be used (0-5 are implemented)</li>
  <li>Multiple callbacks can be attached to a widget or a node</li>
  <li>Callbacks can be dynamically attached to / removed from a widget or a node</li>
  <li>Each argument of callback function can be determined either by a
value (parameter/value binding), pointer to a variable or as a return
value of a sub-call</li>
  <li>Return values can be either stored in a variable (defined by a
pointer), pushed to a sub-call, sent to a node or used by attached
slots as an argument</li>
  <li>Special callback classes - Signals and Slots can emit/accept values of any type and propagate the callback event</li>
  <li>It is an add-on library, you can use both standard fltk callbacks and this library in your program<br>
  </li>
</ul>
