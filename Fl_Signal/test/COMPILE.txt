For *nix, mingw and cygwin systems simply execute

     /your/path/to/fltk-config --compile example.cpp

which builds example executable. For MS VC6 you wil find simple project 
file in visualc subdirectory. Otherwise you just need to compile 
example.cpp (the file #include-s Fl_Signal.cpp for simplicity) and link
 to fltk library (and dep. libs).
